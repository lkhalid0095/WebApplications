Scheme Learning Experience

Scheme was a difficult language to work with because it's so different than java. The syntax used for mathematical operations is infix notation which isa little different. The real trouble were the parentheses, and how many you needed to make sure that you lcosed the method. Also the idea that you need to use parentheses before writing the method, and the method goes inside theparentheses was a foreign concept. Writing lambda expressions was tricky because you had to use recursion overall, I'm more of a for loop person. Running scheme done by changing the mode of the file making it visible and callingit through its path. The thinking that was to be done through conditionals was also different, and making liststs reminded me of arrays that were created. I just had to make sure I used '() and defined the list before hand so I don't have to create the list everytime. It was an interesting exeprience making different algorithms, that I've done in java, but the way of writing it made a lot of change. Debugging Scheme in terminal is weird honestly, because I'm not used to Terminal, and it is a little similar to the console in eclipse, telling me which line is the problem. Overall it was similar in logic but the syntax made a big difference. I used couple of tutorials online in youtube which was helpful in learning the syntax.
