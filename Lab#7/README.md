# README 
	Lab#7 includes 3 files, main.c, addNum.c and the Makefile. The goal of the program is to add a sum and print it.

## Common commands
	'the right side of the Makefile is the target where the two files that weere already created are put. 
	The files are coded in C, since I was having trouble working with java. It was my first time with C and had to watch couple of tutorials to understand that syntax. The program make helps you call multiple files in one file and makes the program by just writn make. I made a simply progrram of adding sums,I tried to add a Scanner but it wasn't working because I was unaware of the syntax.

## NOTES
	Something I can add later is more complicated program where you ask the user the integers and send that s the parameters in the function.
	Another thing to note, create a command that lceans files that are of temporary use.
